In my previous project, I demonstrated drone navigation using keyboard inputs. In this follow-up, I showcase how to control a DJI Tello drone using a joystick. This project leverages the `djitellopy` library for drone communication, `pygame` for joystick input, and `opencv` for video streaming. The code is organized into two main components: a main script and a custom joystick handler class.

## Code Explanation

### main.py

The main script handles core operations: connecting to the drone, managing joystick input, and displaying the camera feed.

```python
import cv2
import pygame
from djitellopy import Tello
from joystickhandler import JoystickHandler


def main():
    # Initialize the drone and joystick handler
    uav = Tello()
    uav.connect()
    print(f"Battery: {uav.get_battery()}%")
    uav.streamon()

    joystick_handler = JoystickHandler()
    img = None

    while True:
        # Check for Pygame events
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                uav.land()
                pygame.quit()
                return

        # Retrieve joystick input and update drone controls
        vals = joystick_handler.get_joystick_input()
        uav.send_rc_control(vals[0], vals[1], vals[2], vals[3])
        joystick_handler.handle_joystick_buttons(uav)

        # Capture and display the camera feed
        img = uav.get_frame_read().frame
        img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
        img = cv2.resize(img, (360, 240))
        cv2.imshow("Image", img)

        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    cv2.destroyAllWindows()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

- **Initialization**: Connects to the Tello drone and sets up the joystick handler.
- **Main Loop**: Continuously checks for Pygame events, updates drone controls based on joystick input, captures the camera feed, and displays it.
- **Exiting**: Handles the quit event by landing the drone, quitting Pygame, and closing OpenCV windows.

### joystickhandler.py

This file defines the `JoystickHandler` class, encapsulating joystick functionality and managing both joystick axis inputs and button events.

```python
import pygame
import time
import cv2


class JoystickHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        pygame.init()
        pygame.joystick.init()
        self._initialize_joystick()

    def _initialize_joystick(self):
        """Initializes the joystick and raises an exception if none is detected."""
        if pygame.joystick.get_count() > 0:
            self._joystick = pygame.joystick.Joystick(0)
            self._joystick.init()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("No joystick detected")

    def get_joystick_input(self):
        """Retrieves joystick axis values and scales them for drone control."""
        speed = 50  # Maximum speed value for the drone
        lr = int(self._joystick.get_axis(2) * speed)  # Axis 2 for left-right
        fb = -int(self._joystick.get_axis(3) * speed)  # Axis 3 for forward-backward
        ud = -int(self._joystick.get_axis(1) * speed)  # Axis 1 for up-down
        yv = int(self._joystick.get_axis(0) * speed)  # Axis 0 for yaw
        return [lr, fb, ud, yv]

    def handle_joystick_buttons(self, uav):
        """Handles joystick button presses to perform actions on the UAV."""
        if self._joystick.get_button(3):  # Button 3 for takeoff
            uav.takeoff()
        elif self._joystick.get_button(0):  # Button 0 for land
            uav.land()
        elif self._joystick.get_button(2):  # Button 2 for capturing an image
            self._capture_image(uav)

    @staticmethod
    def _capture_image(uav):
        """Captures an image from the UAV's camera and saves it."""
        img = uav.get_frame_read().frame
        img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
        cv2.imwrite(f'Resources/Images/{time.time()}.jpg', img)
        time.sleep(0.3)

```

- **Initialization**: Initializes the joystick and raises an exception if no joystick is detected.
- **Joystick Input**: The `get_joystick_input` method retrieves and scales joystick axis values for drone control.
- **Button Handling**: The `handle_joystick_buttons` method performs actions based on button presses, such as takeoff, landing, or capturing an image.

### OOP Principles Followed: Encapsulation and Abstraction

I find that organizing and clearly expressing information helps me understand it better. Therefore, I want to share an explanation of the custom JoystickHandler class in terms of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

**Python’s Philosophy**: Python follows the principle of “we are all consenting adults here,” relying on conventions rather than enforced access control.

**Encapsulation**:
Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. In the `JoystickHandler` class:

- **Data Hiding**: Attributes and methods prefixed with an underscore (e.g., `_joystick`, `_initialize_joystick`) are intended to be private to the class. This convention signals that these are internal details not meant to be accessed directly from outside the class. This helps protect the internal state and implementation details, ensuring they are not inadvertently modified by external code.
- **Controlled Access**: Public methods like `get_joystick_input` and `handle_joystick_buttons` provide controlled access to the joystick’s functionality, making the code easier to maintain and reducing the risk of errors.

**Abstraction**:
Abstraction hides complex implementation details and exposes only the necessary features of an object:

- **Simplified Interface**: The `JoystickHandler` class abstracts the complexity of joystick interaction. Users interact with the joystick through simplified methods without needing to understand the underlying details.
- **Modularity**: By isolating joystick functionality into its own class, the code adheres to modularity. Changes to joystick handling will not affect other parts of the code, enhancing maintainability and readability.
